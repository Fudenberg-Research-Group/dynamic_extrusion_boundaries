# loop extrusion with dynamic boundaries

This github page is designed for polymer simulation of chromatin loop extrusion by Cohesin with dynamic model of CTCF. For this simulaitons, polychrom library (https://github.com/open2c/polychrom) is used. To describe, loop extrusion mechanism is initially implemented on a one-dimensional lattice, and then the data is used as bond input between monomers in polymer simulation, which is performed using OpenMM.
