# loop extrusion with dynamic boundaries

This is a github page for polymer simulation of chromatin loop extrusion by Cohesin with dynamic model of CTCF. Loop extrusion mechanism is initially implemented on a one-dimensional lattice, and then the data is used as bond input between monomers in polymer simulation, which is performed using OpenMM.
